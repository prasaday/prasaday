We are exploring predictive analytics to identify and mitigate unsafe conditions in our company. We used an 80% training set to develop a Random Forest model, which achieved over 95% accuracy on the test set.
My question is: how can we use our Random Forest model to predict future unsafe events? Several peer-reviewed scientific papers apply their models, using different types of algorithms based on the data, to the test set and measure accuracy with various statistical methods.
However, to our knowledge, none of these scientific papers discuss how to predict future unsafe events that can be mitigated by leading indicators.
We would greatly appreciate any input.
